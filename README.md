This project investigates macroeconomic drivers affecting the USD/CAD exchange rate and proposes a hybrid forecasting framework that combines traditional time series modeling (SARIMA) with machine learning (XGBoost and Random Forest).

## Project Pverrie
- wGoal: Forecast the USD/CAD exchange rate one year ahead.

- Approach: Build and compare SARIMA, standalone ML models, and hybrid models.

- Data: Monthly data from 2005 to 2023 for key macroeconomic indicators.
